# This file ensures the Testing Videos directory is tracked by Git
# Test video files for DivyaDrishti AI testing will be stored here
# Video files (*.mp4, *.avi, etc.) are ignored by .gitignore but this folder structure is preserved
# 
# To add test videos to this folder:
# 1. Place your test videos here locally
# 2. The application can access them for testing
# 3. Videos remain local only (not pushed to GitHub due to size)
